*There's a more to-the-point version AND a summary which is in far better shape [over on the gender updates page](/new/). There's also a [faq](/faq/)!*

There once was a boy who worked very hard to keep me safe, but he's tired and deserves to rest. I'm Ginny Maive and it's nice to finally get to meet

## The long-ass version of my story

**WARNING: this seriously is way too much information to share! I am doing this in part to work through my thoughts myself,
and in part on the tiny chance it's helpful to another person struggling with similar problems. It's also very much a work in progress and
chaotic and incomplete!!!!!**

I have struggled with depression and anxiety for my entire life. I'd gotten better at ignoring it, or working around it... but I was miserable.
I couldn't see a way out - I wasn't *happy* in my fantasy life, I was just *less miserable*. Unhappiness took over more and more space inside of
me until that's all that was left.

I didn't understand why I was so miserable. But my brain got a kick out of coming up with theories! It would often lecture me on my deficiencies, of which there were many.
Central to them all: I was uniquely, distinctly, and undeniably terrible. It was like having a mental roommate who kept a running monologue about how I have no redeemable qualities,
that I'd be better off dead, and by the way did you know you could make that happen?

I shambled through life trying to find happiness. Part of being miserable for me was trying to stay busy - being alone was dangerous, and gave that miserable voice
more volume. I spent a lot of time trying to find my happiness inside of other people, that maybe having the perfect girlfriend would fix what was wrong. I picked up hobbies, did
whatever I could to stay occupied. None of this made he happy, none of it changed the hollow I felt inside.

I was dead, but trying to stay productive.

A bit after moving to New York, I started to work on getting better. And I got a little better! Then I bounced between a little better and a little worse for a while. I still never thought
I'd end up *happy*, but it felt like I had a handle on the extremes. I had a good regimen that allayed a lot of my depression.

I still had this angry internal voice, but by this point I‚Äôd convinced myself it was normal. That everyone has a voice that (literally constantly) degrades and insults them, that's just
normal internal dialog.

(In the one-person show that is my life, we have reached the end of the first act.)

On December 22, 2022 I asked a question on social media - what's the difference between *wanting* to be a girl, and, like, actually *being* trans? <small>(Spoiler: not as much as I thought)</small>

![A social media post that says "I'm a guy who always thoguht and assumed he was cis. I've always been drawn to the feminine and wished I was a girl, but I'm not sure that means I am a girl
or how to figure that out. I haven't shared that with anyone, so I'm using this outlet for now.](/images/ginny1.png)

A bunch of people replied and were really nice! Some people had the same question, others had already answered it for themselves. Importantly, [Prudence](https://prudencespossumpad.neocities.org/) sent me a
[link to a site on gender dysphoria](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/).

I spent 5 hours reading that entire website, and every page it links to. Then I made my second post:

![A social media post by the same person that just says "oh"](/images/ginny2.png)

A lot of the stuff which seemed normal to me was less, uh, *standard-issue* than I had thought. It‚Äôs a bit awkward to talk about for a lot of reasons. Some of the stuff is normal*ish* - sure
cis folk might imagine their life as another gender, but probably not every day and with the intensity and desire I felt to not be a boy.

I'm nervously going to list some examples of things I thought were *very normal cis things to do*:

* I hated all parts of my name, and never liked hearing it. (I remember joking in high school that I should take my wife's name. I wonder if I knew I wasn't joking back then.)

* I liked music class growing up, especially singing. Once puberty hit I could not stand the sound of my own voice. I couldn't watch videos with me because hearing my
voice made me extremely unhappy.

* Imagining the future wasn't something I did; when I tried it felt like watching an episode of a TV show I didn't really buy into because of its poor production values.

* I couldn't imagine being happy. My self-improvement was entirely focused on reducing how unhappy I was.

* My body felt like a sack of goo and juice I was forced to lug around. My physical body didn't represent *me* and was entirely disconnected from my consciousness. At the time this felt enlightened,
an absence from carnal desires of the flesh.

* I actively wished I could be *anyone* else. Several times a day, on every day of my life, I would fantasize about having been born a girl. About how much happier I could be,
and how nice it'd be to not have to deal with the whole "being a boy" thing.

* I had/have almost zero interest in "masculine" or male-coded things.

* I was terrified to be around a group of males. In junior high I refused to shower after gym class (as I remember it, all the boys in the class just got naked under a single shower head,
which, to be honest, what the fuck); the gym instructor and I reached a detente when I agreed to take a single shower, once, while alone in the locker room. (I have no idea how he convinced
himself he won that argument.)

* My relationships with women were weird. With one exception, I was not the person who pursued or initiated the relationship. Most of the time I'd just sitting around and then a friend
would start kissing me. The first girl I dated got mad at me for not giving her my sweet smooches; she had a friend tell me and when I still didn't do anything had that same friend break up with me.
lol this one was fun to remember

* I did not look in mirrors, even when getting ready in the morning. I'd maybe take a quick glance to make sure all the important bits are covered and that's it.

* Zero self-worth, and absolutely no confidence in my own decisions and choices. Like a lot of trans girls, I was terrible at trusting my inner voice - it's easier to let other people
tell me who I am.

* An entire absence of emotionality, aside from anger. I had two modes: furious, and numb.

Probably one of the more telling thought experiments: suppose there was [a button that would permanently turn me into a girl](https://turn-me-into-a-girl.com/). On *every day of my life* I would have pressed it
instantly and without a second thought. After pressing it a few extra times to be really sure it activated I would look around for a skirt.

I was reading the [biochemical dysmorphia page](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/biochemical-dysphoria) when I noticed I was crying.

I was [on a different site pressing a button](https://turn-me-into-a-girl.com/) when I noticed a peace and quiet inside of me.

The voice of constant degradation, criticism, and self-hatred was *gone*. The massive presence that had taken over so much territory in my head, and held on so tightly for decades had just‚Ä¶ let go.

I knew I had figured out *something*, but I wasn't quite sure what. I wasn't confident to say for sure this was happening because I was transgender, even though it was kinda hard to step around
the evidence.

So I did a whole lot of therapy‚Ñ¢! I worked on being more honest with myself (which is *super fucking hard*). I worked to reduce my reliance on maladaptive coping mechanisms (avoidance is a big one).
I tried to understand what parts of me are *me*, and what parts were the shell I built to keep myself safe.

And because growth rarely happens in a straight line, I went back and forth a lot - some days convinced it was very obvious I was a transgender woman, other days I knew I was lying to myself and
looking for a simple placebo to make me feel better.

I was in the middle of telling my therapist I was pretty sure I wasn't *actually* trans and really it's just (I don't know where the train of thought was going). As I was saying a bunch of stupid
nonsense, a part of myself made it very clear: gender identity may be complex and confusing, but **I am tired of pretending to be a boy**.

I have never been as confident about anything as I was about that simple statement.

I started transitioning the following week.

I have more to figure out and understand about myself. I‚Äôve grown more confident in having a feminine gender identity, though it still feels weird. Every part of me, every single iota of my existence,
knows I‚Äôm on the right path to becoming who I am inside.

I can truly talk about this forever, either in generalities or specifics. There‚Äôs a lot I glossed over plus I‚Äôm near the end & running out of steam a lil‚Äô.

Gender is weird and confusing. Change is too.

I‚Äôm always here to talk or listen.
