title: Hi! Here are words to describe me.

Hi! My name is Ginny Mae and I found out I was a girl a few months ago!

I go by Mae or Maive usually. I go by my middle name because "Ginny Mae" sounds cuter than "Mae Ginny" (which sounds like I'm about to be
aggressively prayed about).

I'm autistic and have ADHD; as such I'm incompatible with most neurotypicals. I work as a software engineer for a large tech company
and live in the Seattle area.

I'm also a single co-parent of my amazing 8 year old daughter!

I like to post [weird things that pop into my head on Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@ginny), where I am *very well known* for being cute.

If you are nice we can be friends!

Previous editions of me:

* improv performer/director
* New Yorker (i'm walkin' here!)
* cyclist (longest ride ~85 miles)
* a boy (I thought!)
