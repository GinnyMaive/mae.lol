Today is 7 months from when I realized I was transgender.

I don't think enough has changed.

I'm disappointed in myself for the most part, that initial euphoria fades
and now it's hard to be very excited about anything.

Maybe I used up my last chance, now it's back to being miserable.

It took 3 months to be confident to start HRT. Would that have made
any difference? It'd be small, I don't see much after almost 4 months...

I'm not sure what I want out of transitioning anyway. At least, what I
can reasoably want.
