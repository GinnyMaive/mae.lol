today is my 1 year HRT anniversary!

i am doing feminizing HRT; a once-weekly injection of estradiol valerate (~10 mg intramuscularly). this suppliments
my body’s ability to create estrogen to fix the imbalance my body naturally produces. when i first started i also
took a pill daily to reduce my body’s testosterone levels too, but now the estradiol does that well enough on its
own. yay!

so i’ve poked myself with a needle now over 50 times along with about 10 blood tests to monitor my hormone levels.
i don’t like pain. i don’t enjoy having to stab myself with a needle weekly, and if given a choice i would not.

but hrt isn’t a *choice* for me (or for many trans folks) \ 
it is a medical necessity that keeps me alive and functionally human

when folks - even trans folks - discuss hrt, it’s often in context of the *physical* effects of hrt. makes sense -
how i present as a woman is a large part of how i am recognized as a person. having a more feminine appearance makes
me more likely to be seen as who i identify as.

hrt does a lot of things to the body; the most obvious ones are causing breast growth and changing where the body
stores fat. some aren’t visible: my body runs about 5 degrees cooler than it did before so I’m cold all the time.
I smell different and no longer have boy smell. and exactly like cis women, I no longer poop.

what doesn’t get talked about a lot is how signifcant an impact hrt has on the mind.

i’m old to be this early in transition. i have little to no chance of ever presenting as a gender-conforming female.
the small changes are nice to see and make me happy… but hrt hasn’t had a signficant impact on my appearance. if
the only positive changes were physical, i might not bother taking hrt.

(an important note here: hrt isn’t what makes a person transgender. hrt isn’t necessary to validate someone’s transition or transness. I would still be transgender, still be a woman, and still be entirely valid in both of those things if I had never started hrt or chose to stop.)

here’s something i’d like you to try to take literally: **i did not exist in any meaningful sense before i began hrt**.
not in some backwards looking, “oh i was so differnt then. oh how ive changed” way. i mean those words quite literally.

before HRT, i had access to about one emotion: anger (and sleepiness if you count that as an emotion). it was easily
accessible and effective. i experienced other emotions through the lens of that anger. Sadness is easy to turn into
anger. Happniess was a lack of self-hatred and anger. Love was whomever stuck around through all my bullshit. if
you’ve ever seen me truly *off the rails angry*, that’s how i acted and treated myself every day of my life for over
thirty years

my “self” was a stack of coping mechanisms built out of fear and self-hatred. i only existed in context to other
people, because who i was at any moment was derived from what i thought they wanted or needed from me.

with access to positive emotions like *happiness and joy*, relationships are based on more than just what can be lost
or taken away. my focus isn’t just *how can i not be abandoned by this person*, because there’s so much more to feel.

i’m still working to not fall back on my old behaviors, especially when i’m feeling negative emotions. i have the
tools and mental space now, but it’s *so much fucking work* unlearning 30 years of mostly-subconscious behavior.
becoming a whole person is a lot of work!

there have been some moments i’m proud of, though. things i never thought i would love and respect myself enough to
say and do. i never thought i would feel the same protective love and energy i have for other people, for *myself*

but i have someone important i need to keep safe now
