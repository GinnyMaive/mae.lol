title: Hi! I'm Ginny Maive! Welcome to my web page!

![an animated gif that says "welcome to my homepage"](/images/welcome.gif)

I'm Ginny Mae, a stereotypical girl who enjoys:

* programming
* video games
* linux
* puns
* collecting domains
* antiquated web design
* talking
* shoes

My pronouns are she/it. \
I use the name Ginny or Ginny Mae socially, and Mae for when I am pretending to be an adult.

I'm not too sure why you're here but maybe for one of these links! &#128073;&#x1f448;

* gender/personality [changelog and patch notes](/new/)
* [faq on me and gender](/faq/) and lots more!
* [about this ginny maive](/about/) person
* way too much about my past and history \
  *(still working on that, it's really long you don't want to read it anyway tbh)*
* my blog but since i will forget about it after a couple posts, I'm just forgetting it now

I'm always open to talking to anyone and you don't have to worry if it's awkward because I am more awkward than you I promise!

Hope you're having a great day!
