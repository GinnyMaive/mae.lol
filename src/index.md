Hiya, I'm Ginny! Welcome to my homepage!

I'm a transfem software engineer based in the Seattle area.

Before graduating with a bachelor of science in computer science (science), I founded my own web startup. It was fun
being part of the dotcom bubble :) I also did cs internships at a couple companies while in college.

In my professional career I've worked at a couple large tech companies. I've worked as an individual contributor, team lead, and manager.
I primarily work on backend projects; most recently I've been developing large-scale data processing pipelines.

I'm motivated by enabling other peoples' success: as a peer mentor I've helped dozens of engineers grow in their careers, as a lead I've helped new teammates
become productive contributors, and as a manager helped my reports navigate chaos and get properly acknowledged for their work.

I'm *absolutely terrible* at needless bureaucracy and toil.

Beyond my professional life, I'm a single parent of an amazing daughter. I also write fiction and think about buying a 3D printer. I should buy one right?

Online I post irreverent one-liners and correct hot tech takes [on Mastodon](https://chaosfem.tw/@ginny). \
I'm funny even when nobody else thinks I am.
