title: logan meehan raped me (aka commenter25 / commenter)

My intent on this page was to warn a community about a man who assaulted me.
In that community he's known as commenter25 or sometimes just commenter or c;
his real life name is Logan Meehan (or maybe Mehan?)

My intent *before* this page was just to know that he understood he had done
something wrong.

His partner is a nano-celebrity and doxxed me and turned the entire community
against the victim of their partners' assault.

There's not much sense in keeping this page up with a detailed statement
as it no longer serves any value toward my goal. It will always remain the
truth - I'm not taking back anything I said - and it's also going to remain
in the git archive if it's ever helpful to the next victim.
