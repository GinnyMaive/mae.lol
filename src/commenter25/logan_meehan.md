In January 2024, Logan Meehan raped me.

## some background

(i will keep this as brief as possible; if anything is unclear or needs expansion i can)

logan came to visit me mid january for our first irl meeting. he flew to seattle (~8 hour flight each way)  and stayed at my house for a week. 

> logan hadn’t ever been able to visit his monogamous gf (USA-UK travel is expensive). The understanding when we planned the trip was:
> 1. we were only friends (ie, our relationship is not a romantic relationship)
> 2. his monogamous girlfriend (nano / rae) knew everything and was comfortable with it
> 3. Logan wanted to lose his virginity and so we would probably have sex

A few days before the trip, logan started getting clingy and manic. Despite having established guidelines he often ignored them and expressed that he wanted much more; he kept saying he needed to move to Seattle to live with me and that he just wouldn’t go home from his visit. Then he would say he’s fucking everything up and go non-verbal, then he’d start planning to move in with me again, then he'd disappear for a bit...

> I never offered or suggested Logan live with me, nor would it have been plausible. Throughout this and the following weeks I had to continuously remind him i never offered a relationship or cohabitation to him *in any way*. He did not consider my opinion important to this decision.

I thought most of that wasn't very serious. But while here, logan talked endlessly about living with me and how we belong together. After a couple days of this I asked him point blank what he had told his monogamous girlfriend about visiting me and how she would feel about him being so... romantically attached to someone else. Our relationship started to feel very unethical.

That's when he told me he had lied before, and basically hadn't told his girlfriend *anything* about his visit. Just said "I'm going to see someone I will have sex with" and he ignored her discomfort. He hadn't even told her it was someone *she knew*.

I shouted at him a bit for lying to his girlfriend and his excuse was that he was unhappy because Rae is asexual and since she wasn’t satisfying his needs she was failing him as a girlfriend. He told me he was checked out of the relationship and that it didn't matter.

Shorly after that converstaion I find a reason to leave the house, my idea being to give him some time alone to figure out his shit.

## the rape

When i came back, Logan tells me he had talked with Rae and she had agreed to fix herself for him by being more sexual and attentive to his desires. Given that fact, we needed to establish new boundaries because he had recommitted himself and didn’t need to use me for those things anymore.

**at this point we define very clear boundaries with each other: friends with no more sexual contact.**

Pulling back our friendship and relationship was sudden and my bpd is triggered. I’m a crying mess and dissociating but stay slightly focused by planning how to get this guy out of my house. Or figuring out how the rest of the week would work or what we would do (he didn't want to leave the house and be seen with me in public, so... there wasn't a lot to do)

Eventually we are both seated on the couch, I assume watching some show but I’m incapable of paying attention. I go between staring at the wall and crying, and occasionally looking at my phone and hoping one of my friends will message me back. Any time I so much as check my phone, Logan makes comments about me “being distracted” and that I'm being rude... so I stop doing that and just stare at the wall and cry.

> This is something in retrospect I realize was intentional, to keep me isolated and dependent on him for any comfort, since he could see how visibly upset I was.

At some point I feel Logan move closer, and then he starts touching me. Anywhere he touched me, my body would go dead. I don’t move. I don’t move at all the whole time, until he’s done with me, except to wipe tears out of my face.

Logan does more and more sexual stuff to my catatonic body. I don’t fully register what is happening because my brain isn’t understanding, but it does know that we arent staying within the boundaries established an hour prior.

**i was motionless and nonverbal \
i gave no consent \
i did not actively participate \
i did not want this sexual contact, and logan forced it on me**

… ill skip describing the actual raping if that’s okay? \
anyway logan uses me until he’s finished.


## after logan finishes rapes me

after he was done with my body, i walked away to clean mouth, and after a few minutes dissociated and confused about what had happened…  i got angry, furious. i walked over next to him and angrily explained some of my emotions to logan. he freezes up, cries, shakes, and panicks.

> This is Logan’s defense mechanism. He acts pathetic and incapable. In a span of a week he threatened suicide more times than I can count.

**At some point i ask explicitly how he thought what he had just done to me was okay. we had just established boundaries, i was clearly upset and triggered, and i did not say i wanted this**  and his answer was “because rae said she didn’t mind if I did”. At no point ever, even after he had just used my motionless body, did my consent or even existence occur to him to consider.

> Logan is a chaser who seeks out insecure trans women to take advantage of, and his inability to see trans women as human felt… very evident in retrospect.

And that’s why I think Logan Meehan is dangerous: he sexually assaulted me and still doesn’t think he did anything wrong. I don’t think he’s capable of understanding consent is necessary even from people you’re using or that you don’t care about. 

Having sex with a motionless, crying girl who didn’t consent  isn’t even something that popped into Logan’s mind as a problem.
