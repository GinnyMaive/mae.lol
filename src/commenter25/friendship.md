title: my friendship with commenter25 aka commenter
---
Lots of people have judged me for having a friendship with Commenter.

## Why were you hanging out with Commenter you creep?

Commenter was my third or fourth friend I met on Mastodon, during my process of discovering and coming out as transgender. He was one of my closest friends. During the first part of our relationship I didn’t know his precise age (I knew he was an adult) and our relationship was entirely platonic.

We started becoming closer friends when he started to DM me in late July; Commenter started flirting with me a couple weeks later.

I learned he was eighteen in late August after we had been friends for a few weeks and he had started flirting with me. Prior to this **I knew commenter was a legal adult because he had told me he was enlisted in the US military (Air Force).**

Is being friends with an 18 year old weird? Yes it is, but also… no? There’s nothing inherently wrong with an age-gapped friendship. For most of our friendship, **I was a girl attracted to girls and he was a gay guy. Especially before he began flirting with me, the friendship felt quite safe.**

I grew close to Commenter because he reminds me so much of myself at his age. Terrified, lost, and just… overwhelmed. Too effeminine for mainstream society, confused and traumatized. His autisticness was really well aligned with my own. When he made a game and asked me to playtest it, I had no fucking clue what anything meant but I still recognized the humor.

We had started talking about spending time together in person while our relationship was platonic, before we had ever flirted. Pre-trip we talked a lot about how his visit was about our friendship. I told him even if Rae didn’t want us to have physical contact that it’d still be a fun trip. I’m a self-conscious transfem so I also kept reminding him it was okay if he wasn’t attracted to me because we would still have so much to talk about, together. I told him I might have a straight panic and not be interested in anything physical, returning to lesbianism after a bi-curious phase.

**Commenter and I had discussed that our connection was about friendship, probably every day we talked.**

**We started talking seriously about booking a plane ticket for the visit during a really rough time for Commenter. He had just been discharged from the Air Force for threatining to kill himself, and so his fairly long-term life plan of surviving as a career member of the active military disappeared suddenly.** When he came back, I knew commenter would feel isolated at home in rural texas with an under-supportive family, and he needed some time to reset from the trauma. **Honestly, he deserved a fucking vacation.**

> When Commenter first told me he was enlisted in the Air Force and leaving for training in a few weeks, I cried the entire night. I was awake until 4 or 5 AM in bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to figure out a way to convince him not to go… and I accepted there wasn’t anything I could do and watched it happen in horror.
>
> I had only known Commenter for a handful of months and I knew there was no way this man would survive the military. He had already told me stories of being overwhelmed working a retail cash register, the military was going to fucking tear this guy apart. Which it did.
>
> When he left, I was one of 3 people Commenter told he was enrolled in the miliitary (he was very ashamed). I wrote him 5 or 6 letters (iirc he said I wrote him more than anyone else), he sent one or two back. My letters were entirely platonic (I didn’t know if there was a risk to being flirty).

> **Commenter realized after a few days that the Air Force kills people, told a chaplain he was going to kill himself, and was able to depart under honorable circumstances.**

After he washed out of the military, I suggested we go somewhere and spend a weekend together. I tried joking about this being my way of supporting the troop but he wasn’t a troop anymore. Joke bombed. I think he chuckled at “mutual aid for stressed out cis men” but idk, not my best work. In my mind meeting somewhere for a weekend trip made sense to me beccause he was living in a small(ish?) town in Texas and I am a trans lady. I spent time researching trans-friendly weekend ideas but Commenter wanted to just spend the time at my house doing nothing.

> A thing I ignored while booking the trip was discovering that commenter **did not want to be seen in public with me to a near-paranoid level.** I assumed he just found me embarassing to look at which I get but, basically he just wanted to stay inside the same shelter the entire trip so… so i guess… my house. I thought about at least going to a nicer place but he seemed anxious about even that so… my house for a weekend.

The trip started as a weekend, but Commenter kept pushing for longer and longer. I did get extending the trip given the flight length (~8 hours one way) but he was pushing to come for week**S**. I negotiated him down to a week but I was really not sure I would want to be around someone 24/7 for a *week*, especially considering we had never spent time together in person. Heck, before we met in person we had a single voice chat and I’d only seen a few well-angled photos.

So roughly he was in my house for about 160 hours. Take 50 hours out for sleep. We didn’t have much sex, so let’s call that 5 hours. That leaves over 100 hours of just … being alone together.  Neither of us used our phone or laptop, with a couple of rare exceptions. We only left the house once or maybe twice to pick up food. **We were close friends. The trip was about those other 100 hours together, not sex.**

While here I spent time helping him unravel what his life had become. He was terrified because his future, absent the military, was entirely unknown. He expected his dad to start pressuring him to take a job he wouldn’t be able to handle.

**At some point during the trip he had a major meltdown over the expectation he gets a job. I calmed him down, and tried to make the things seem more accomplishable. I offered to help him find ways to evaluate what jobs had tasks that wouldn’t constantly trigger him.** I explained some ideas for how he could better prepare for and emotionally handle talking with his dad. I helped him format his resume so that he could start applying for jobs and suggested job opportunities.

**(By the way Commenter, how would you have felt if, in your moment of complete crisis, instead of comforting you I started having sex with your motionless body?)** *(please don’t actually answer that question)*

Our friendship went off the rails when Commenter became obsessed with me (or, at least, the idea that I could solve all his problems for him). He ramped up his pressure and manipulation trying to live with me and date, which I had told him repeatedly *would not happen*.

> **This was hard for me because Commenter’s pressure leaned hard on the insecurities he knew I (and many transfemmes) have, but I did my best to keep pushing him to pay attention to Rae and telling him he needs to be more ethical with her.**

I encouraged him to focus on Rae and re-emphasized over and over again there is no relationship in our future. I encouraged him to work on his relationship with Rae, and that she’s a perfect partner for him.

**I agree entirely that *dating* Commenter, given our age and capability differences, would be unethical. But I don’t think becoming someone’s friend and wanting to help them succeed is unethical.** And **when Commenter pushed our relationship to become sexual, I didn’t see a problem being a standin body for his girlfriend… whom he has never seen face to face, lives in another country, and who was comfortable in general with casual sex. Personally, I’d never been attracted to or had sex with a man, and thought it would be safe to experiment with a friend.**

This incompatibility, yet Commenter randomly pressuring me for a dating relationship, is why “power dynamics” was something we joked about. **It became a joke because i had to keep telling Commenter over and over that there are good reasons we can’t be in a relationship and that he isn’t allowed to move into my house.**

Or, more specifically and directly to Rae: **power dynamics became a joke because I kept having to explain them to your boyfriend so that his dumb ass would pay attention to his partner instead of me.**

Shortly after returning home Commenter confessed to being suicidal because he ruined “our chance”. He told me he had plans for how to kill himself, had written notes, and told me he threw away the dog collar he had me buy him (with my name and phone number on it) where his dad would find it. That’s when I began to protect myself and pull back from this “friendship”.

I reached out to Rae to explain what happened during the trip directly because I no longner expected Commenter to treat Rae ethically if I didn't. That conversation with Rae convinced me I had to say something:

The only thing I have wanted from talking about this is to not let Commenter find another trans girl and do it again. Nano gives Commenter close access and authority in a group of extremely vulnerable people,, but she can’t recognize that Commenter is a danger. When Commenter assaulted me, she threatened me if I ever talked about things. She shared my private information and attacked me and my character in any way possible so that nobody could ever believe me.

> Before anything had been public, nano repeatedly told me that she would tell everyone my age and they wouldn’t believe me, and would judge and ostracize me from the community – bringing up several incidents in the past where the older person in a relationship is pushed out because of an age gapped relationship. The message was clear that she would lean hard on the fact that I’m older than Commenter thus… I can’t be raped by him? (And indeed this is what Nano did when she posted about it, she dug into the fact that I’m old and that makes me in her mind unrapeable).

Rae knows everything that happened, and knows that her boyfriend is abusive.
